# R Shiny script to display UMAP template analysis data as an interactive R Shiny webpage.
# Last edited: 19/02/26. Tom
# Seurat UMAP analysis code is taken from: https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html
# Analysis is currently mostly identical to the tutorial code, using the sample data they provide. (Place in same directory as app.R)
# R shiny code currently displays 2 tabs and allows the user to select specific clusters to show
# Future goals:
#   - Reduce Seurat analysis code to be only whats needed for Shiny
#   - Improve Shiny code to allow the user to search for individual cells
#   - Change layout of Shiny to be ready for displaying multiple graphs on each tab
#   - Consider splitting server and ui code into separate scripts
#   - See if Seurat code can be on separate script (Or find a way of avoiding script running multiple times)
